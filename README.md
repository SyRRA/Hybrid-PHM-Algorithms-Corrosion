# Hybrid_PHM_Algorithms_Corrosion
This file contains Python and OpenBUGS codes and results for degradation modeling of piggable oil and gas pipelines due to 
internal pitting corrosion.
Population-Based-Hybrid_Algorithm in conjunction with three OpenBUGS files (main code for D_1, D_2, D_3) should be used for the population-based algorithm.
